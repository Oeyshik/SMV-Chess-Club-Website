## How the Project is Made

Briefly describe how the project is developed, the technologies used, and any other relevant information. For example:

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is divided into different sections, each represented by an HTML file (e.g., `about.html`, `contact.html`). Styling is applied using separate CSS files corresponding to each section. JavaScript files like `main.js` and `register.js` add interactivity and functionality to the website. Additionally, `server.js` handles server-side functionality, and the `package.json` file manages project dependencies.
